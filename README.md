<h1>Litteratura</h1>
A CLI program that uses <a href="https://gutendex.com/">Gutendex API</a> for searching books and saves it in a local database

<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>For each new searched book, the program saves it in the local PostgreSQL database (which should be installed on your system), <br>
providing you with several options. Two of these options are to retrieve the books or authors you've already saved.</p>

<h3>Pre configs</h3>
<p>Don't forget to create this database in your PostgreSQL...</p>
